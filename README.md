## Technical Capabilities

### 1. Authentication and Authorization
- **Spring Security**: Utilizes Spring Security's `UserDetailsService` interface to load user data and manages unauthorized access by throwing an `UnAuthorizedException`.
- **UserRepository**: Provides access to user information through the `UserRepository` interface, facilitating secure authentication and authorization within the web server application.
- **UserDetailsImpl**: Authenticates users by providing their authorities, password, username, and account status based on the user object passed to it.

### 2. Employee Management
- **EmployeeController**: Manages employee-related operations within the application, including retrieving employee details by ID and creating new employees via RESTful API endpoints.
- **EmployeeService**: Encapsulates business logic for employee management, including retrieving and saving employee data.

### 3. Error Handling
- **ErrorDTO**: Represents the `ErrorDTO` model, encapsulating key information about errors encountered during web server operations.
- **GlobalExceptionHandler**: Handles exceptions globally within the application, providing custom error responses for specific exception types.

### 4. Testing
- **WebserverTestApplicationTests**: Provides a Spring Boot-based test suite to support comprehensive testing of the web server application.
